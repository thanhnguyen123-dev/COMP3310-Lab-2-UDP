"""
    Python UDP echo server program for ANU COMP3310.

    This is one half of a traditional Internet client-server architecture.
    As a server this program is expected to run (more or less) all the
    time, and handle requests from any client that connects.

    Run with
        python udpServer.py [ IP addr ] [ port ]
